### Sales and Inventory - VB.NET

A sample application that reads, creates, updates and deletes entries from a Microsoft Access Database using OleDB on VB.NET. Very useful for programming class demonstrations.

Built on Visual Studio 2015 and Microsoft Access 2016 (should work fine on older versions). Database file is located on /Debug/data.accdb and is loaded dynamically *(as long as the database file is named data.accdb and resides beside the executable binary, it will be loaded by the program).*

Please note that this code is meant for simple programming class demonstrations, and **does not** include SQL Injection protection logic like entry sanitation and escaping.
